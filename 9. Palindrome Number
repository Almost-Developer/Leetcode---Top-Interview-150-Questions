Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Constraints:
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Approach:
1. Take the last digit of the number and divide the number by 10
2. Store the previous digit and repeat the the process until number is more than zero
3. check the stored number is equal to the original number

Solution.
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 121;
        boolean res = palindrome(num);
        System.out.println(res);
    }
    public static boolean palindrome(int temp) {
        int rev = 0;
        int num = temp;
        while(num != 0) {
            int digit = num%10;
            rev = rev*10 + digit;
            num = num/10;
        }
        return rev == temp;
    }
}
