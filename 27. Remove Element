Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
 
Constraints:
0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100

Approach:
1. take a pointer on the index which will be at zero.
2. iterate over the array and check for the value matches with said value.
3. if it does matches skip the element.
4. otherwise let the element be and iterate index pointer.

Solution.

import java.util.Arrays;
class Solution {
    public static int removeElement(int[] nums, int target) {
        int index = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] != target) {
                nums[index++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 2, 2, 3};
        int target = 3;
        
        int result = removeElement(nums, target);
        System.out.print(result);
    }
}
